    <div class="col-7">
      <p>In Chinese mythology, the creation of the world is often attributed to Pangu, a giant who emerged from a cosmic egg containing chaos (Yin and Yang).</p>
      <p> Pangu separated the egg's contents, creating heaven (Yang) and earth (Yin), and then died, with his body parts transforming into various aspects of the world.</p>
      <p>In Chinese mythology, the world was created by Pangu, a primordial giant who emerged from a cosmic egg containing chaos and yin and yang. Pangu separated the yin and yang, with the lighter part becoming the sky and the heavier part becoming the earth. He then grew taller, pushing the sky and earth further apart until they reached their current positions. After 18,000 years, Pangu died, and his body transformed into various elements of the natural world, including mountains, rivers, and even humanity.</p>

    <h3>Major Gods and Goddesses</h3>

      <p>Chinese mythology features a wide array of gods and goddesses, with some of the most prominent including the Jade Emperor, Nuwa, Fuxi, and the Four Symbols (Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise). Other important deities include Shangdi, Guanyin, Mazu, and various figures associated with nature, such as the gods of wood, fire, water, and earth. </p>
      <p> Although the use of "Tian" to refer to the absolute God of the universe is predominant in Chinese religion today, "Shangdi" continues to be used in a variety of traditions, including certain philosophical schools, certain strains of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, some Chinese salvationist religions (notably)</p>
      <p> Fuxi. God of Civilization, Culture, and Heaven. Focus: Human Soldiers and Heroes.Nüwa. Goddess of Creation and the Earth. Focus: Peasants, Kuafus, and Defense.Shennong. God of Agriculture and Herbal Medicine. Focus: Farming, Myth Units, and Healing.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-7">
      <p>In Chinese mythology, the afterlife is a complex system where souls journey to the Underworld (Diyu) for judgment and potential purification or reincarnation. It's not a single, static "hell" but rather a realm of multiple levels and judges, where souls face consequences for their actions in life. Those deemed virtuous may be reincarnated, while others face various punishments before eventually returning to the cycle of rebirth.</p>
      <p>Diyu is a subterranean realm, often depicted with multiple levels and chambers, each with its own judges and punishments. The most well-known judges are the Ten Yama Kings, who preside over the different levels and assess the souls' deeds. </p>
      <p>The Underworld is a place of judgment and accountability, not eternal damnation. Souls are held accountable for their actions in life and may face punishments before eventually being reincarnated.</p>

    <h3>Cosmic Struggles</h3>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>In Chinese mythology, the concept of good versus evil is not as rigidly defined as in some other cultures, but rather often manifests as a cosmic struggle between opposing forces and the pursuit of harmony. Rather than a simple binary, good and evil are often seen as complementary aspects of the universe, with the ideal being a balance between them.</p>
      <p>Spirits and Deities While often associated with power and good fortune, dragons can also be seen as forces of nature, sometimes benevolent, sometimes destructive. These are often mischievous or dangerous supernatural beings that can cause harm to humans. Diyu is a realm where souls atone for their sins, suggesting a system of consequences for negative actions. Hungry Ghosts: Spirits of those who died with strong desires or unresolved issues, representing a negative consequence of earthly actions. Chiyou.</p>

    <h3>Temples and Rituals</h3>
    <div class="col-7">
      <p>Chinese temples and rituals are deeply intertwined with religious and cultural practices, including Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and ancestor veneration. Temples serve as places of worship, spiritual cultivation, and community gathering, often featuring specific architectural styles and layouts. Rituals, ranging from formal ceremonies to daily practices, are central to these traditions, reflecting beliefs about the cosmos, the afterlife, and the interconnectedness of the living and the deceased.</p>
      <p>Traditional classification of domestic rituals has four main categories: guan (initiation), hun (wedding), sang (funeral), and ji (ancestral rites). Of the first three life-cycle rites, guan, or coming-of-age capping, is rarely practiced in modern China. Chinese temple architecture refer to a type of structures used as place of worship of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or Chinese folk religion, where people revere ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors.</p>
