  <h1>Creation Myths</h1>
  <img src="../Img/asset/bg.jpg" alt="Hiranyagarbha Cosmic Egg" />
  <p>Hindu Creation myths are diverse and appear in many ancient texts like the Rigveda, Upanishads, Puranas, and epics(Mahabharata and Ramayana).<br>These stories often reflect a transition from chaod to order, form formless void or cosmic waters to structured universe of life.</p>

    <h2>Hiranyagarbha</h2>
    <p>In the beginning, there was nothing.From the darkness emerged a golden egg-<br><strong>Hiranyagarbha</strong> It gave birth to <strong>Brahma</strong>, who created the universe.</p>
<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hiranyagarbha</strong> means "golden womb" or "golden egg".</li>
      <li>In the beginning, there was complete darkness and no existence—only vast cosmic waters.</li>
      <li>From these waters emerged a golden egg, the <em>Hiranyagarbha</em>, which floated in the void.</li>
      <li>Inside the egg, <strong>Brahma</strong> was born, who broke the shell and created heaven, earth, and the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>He is considered the creator god in Hinduism and started the process of life and time.</li>
      <li>This myth shows how life and order emerged from formless chaos.</li>

    <img src="../Img/asset/suktam.jpg" alt="Purusha sukta" />
    <h2>Purusha Sukta</h2>
    <p>The cosmic being <strong>Purusha</strong> was sacrified. From his body parts came the elements, castes, sun, moon, and air- showing unity of creation.</p>
    <br>
      <li>The <strong>Purusha Sukta</strong> is a hymn in the Rig Veda describing creation through a cosmic sacrifice.</li>
      <li>Purusha is a divine cosmic being with a thousand heads, eyes, and feet—symbolizing infinity.</li>
      <li>The gods performed a great sacrifice, offering Purusha’s body to create the universe.</li>
      <li>From Purusha's body:
        <ul>
          <li>Mouth → Brahmins (priests)</li>
          <li>Arms → Kshatriyas (warriors)</li>
          <li>Thighs → Vaishyas (merchants)</li>
          <li>Feet → Shudras (laborers)</li>
          <li>Mind → Moon, Eyes → Sun, Breath → Wind</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This myth explains not just creation but the origin of society, nature, and the Vedic caste system.</li>
      <li>It reflects the unity of the cosmos and social harmony.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <img src="../Img/asset/suktaaa.jpg" alt="Nasadiya sukta" />
    <h2>Nasadiya Sukta</h2>
    <p>The vedic hymm wonders how the universe began- and whether even the goals truly know. It's a mystery-filled creation poem.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>This is one of the most philosophical and mysterious hymns of the Rig Veda (10.129).</li>
      <li>It questions how the universe was created and whether anyone truly knows the origin of everything.</li>
      <li>Main ideas from the hymn:
        <ul>
          <li>In the beginning, there was neither existence nor non-existence.</li>
          <li>No air, sky, death, or immortality — just an unmanifest, still darkness.</li>
          <li>From intense heat (tapas), creation began, but the exact source is unknown.</li>
          <li>Even the gods came later, so maybe the true origin is beyond all knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The hymn ends with: <em>“He who is in the highest heaven, may or may not know.”</em></li>
      <li>This Sukta shows that Hinduism welcomes uncertainty and deep questioning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vishnu and Lotus</h2>
    <p>Lord <strong>Vishnu</strong> lies on a serpent in the cosmic ocean.A lotus grows from his navel,giving birth to <strong>Barhma</strong> , the creator.</p>
      <li>In Vaishnavism, the universe is created through <strong>Lord Vishnu</strong>, the preserver of the cosmos.</li>
      <li>He lies on the serpent <strong>Ananta Shesha</strong> floating on the ocean of milk (<em>Kshira Sagar</em>).</li>
      <li>From his navel grows a lotus flower, from which <strong>Brahma</strong> is born.</li>
      <li>Brahma then begins the work of creating the universe: sky, earth, living beings, and time.</li>
      <li>This creation cycle is part of a divine trinity:
        <ul>
          <li>Brahma – Creator</li>
          <li>Vishnu – Preserver</li>
          <li>Shiva – Destroyer</li>
        </ul>

<div class="topic-box" id="Underworld">
    <h1>Underworld and Afterlife</h1>
    <img src="../Img/asset/Yama_on_buffalo.jpg" alt="Underworld and After">
  <p>
    Hindu mythology teaches that the soul (Atman) is immortal and goes through many lives in a cycle called <strong>Samsara</strong>. After death, the soul is judged by <strong>Yama</strong>, the god of death, based on its <strong>karma</strong> — the good and bad actions done in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good souls are rewarded with time in <strong>Swarga</strong> (heaven), a place of joy ruled by Indra. Sinners are sent to <strong>Naraka</strong> (hell), where they face punishment before being reborn. There are 28 types of Naraka, each for different sins. But both Swarga and Naraka are temporary — the soul returns to Earth for another life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ultimate goal is <strong>Moksha</strong> — freedom from the cycle of rebirth and union with the divine. Hindu cosmology also speaks of <strong>14 Lokas</strong> (realms), including higher spiritual worlds and lower underworlds, which are part of this grand cosmic journey.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic-box" id="good vs evil">
  <h1>Good vs. Evil / Cosmic Struggles</h1>
  <img src="../Img/asset/good vs evil.jpg" alt="good vs evil">
  <p>
    In Hindu mythology, the universe is shaped by a constant battle between the forces of good and evil. The gods, known as <strong>Devas</strong>, represent light, truth, and order, while the demons, called <strong>Asuras</strong>, stand for ego, chaos, and darkness. This eternal conflict reflects the deeper struggle between <strong>Dharma</strong> (righteousness) and <strong>Adharma</strong> (unrighteousness), not just in the world but within every individual.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stories like <strong>Durga’s victory over Mahishasura</strong>, <strong>Rama defeating Ravana</strong>, and <strong>Krishna guiding Arjuna in the Mahabharata</strong> show how divine forces protect balance and justice. These cosmic battles are not only physical but also symbolic — showing how wisdom, courage, and devotion can overcome arrogance and evil. Even demons are sometimes shown with complexity, reminding us that good and evil often arise from imbalance or ignorance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The message is clear: the universe remains in harmony when Dharma is upheld. And though darkness may rise, light always finds a way to restore balance. These timeless stories inspire humans to face their inner battles with strength, humility, and truth.
  </p>

<div class="topic-box" id="symbol">
  <h1>Symbols and Sacred Objects</h1>
  <img src="../Img/asset/HinduSwastika.svg.png" alt="symbols and sacred objects">
  <p>
    Hindu mythology is rich with sacred symbols, animals, and divine objects that carry deep spiritual meaning. One of the most powerful symbols is the <strong>Trishul (trident)</strong>, the weapon of Lord Shiva, representing creation, preservation, and destruction. The <strong>Chakra (discus)</strong> carried by Vishnu symbolizes the cycle of time and dharma, while the <strong>Lotus</strong>, often seen with deities like Lakshmi and Brahma, signifies purity, beauty, and spiritual awakening rising from the muddy waters of the material world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among sacred animals, the <strong>cow</strong> is most revered as a symbol of nourishment and motherhood, and <strong>Garuda</strong>, a mighty eagle, serves as Vishnu’s divine mount. <strong>Nandi</strong>, the sacred bull, is Lord Shiva’s vehicle and represents strength and devotion. Weapons like <strong>Vajra (thunderbolt)</strong> used by Indra symbolize indestructible power, and the <strong>Damaru</strong> (Shiva’s drum) represents the cosmic sound of creation. Even plants like the <strong>Tulsi</strong> (holy basil) are considered sacred and worshipped for their purifying energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    These symbols are not just decorative or mythic tools—they carry timeless messages about the divine forces, moral values, and spiritual truths that shape the Hindu worldview.

    <h1>Temples and Rituals in Hinduism</h1>
    <img src="../Img/asset/t.jpg" alt="temples and rituals">
    <p>
    Hindu temples, also known as mandirs, are sacred structures symbolizing the universe. Key architectural features include the 
    <strong>Garbha Griha</strong> (inner sanctum), <strong>Shikhara</strong> (tower), <strong>Mandapa</strong> (hall), and 
    <strong>Pradakshina patha</strong> (circumambulatory path). Rituals such as <strong>puja</strong>, <strong>yajna</strong>, 
    and celebrations like <strong>Diwali</strong> and <strong>Holi</strong> are central to Hindu tradition.
    <div class="ritual"><img src="../Img/asset/ritual.jpg" alt="Infographic of Hindu Temples and Rituals" >
    <img src="../Img/asset/templ.jpg"></div><p>Priests (purohits), often from the Brahmin caste, conduct these rituals. Offerings include flowers, food, and sacred items. 
    Spiritual practices like meditation and yoga are also essential. Symbols such as <strong>Om</strong>, <strong>Swastika</strong>, 
    and the <strong>Lingam</strong> are deeply rooted in Hindu belief systems.
